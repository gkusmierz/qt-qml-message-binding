# qt-qml-message-binding

This project demonstrates how to bind C++ messages to QML properties using Qt's signal and slot mechanism.

## Features

- Binding C++ messages to QML properties.
- Updating QML UI based on C++ message changes.
- Example with a simple message structure.

## Prerequisites

- Qt 5 or 6
- A C++ compiler

## Build and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/qt-qml-message-binding.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd qt-qml-message-binding
   ```

3. Build the project using qmake:
   ```bash
   qmake
   make
   ```

4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./qt-qml-message-binding
   ```

## Project Structure

- `main.cpp`: Entry point of the application.
- `messagehandler.h` and `messagehandler.cpp`: Contains the `MessageHandler` class responsible for handling messages and emitting signals.
- `message.h`: Defines the `Message` structure.
- `main.qml`: QML file defining the UI and binding to C++ properties.

## How it Works

The `MessageHandler` class has a `message` property of type `Message`. When the message content changes in C++, the `messageChanged` signal is emitted.  In `main.qml`, the UI elements are bound to the properties of the `message` object exposed by the `MessageHandler`, ensuring that the UI updates automatically when the message changes.

## Example

The example demonstrates a simple message with `title` and `content` fields.  The QML UI displays these fields and updates whenever a new message is received from the C++ side.
